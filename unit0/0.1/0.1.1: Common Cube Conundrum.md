## Common Cube Conundrum

Answer: The dark line marked from Path A to Path B is not the shortest route from A to B

As,
The pythagoras theorem states 

**A^2 + B^2 = C^2**



if we let the upper left corner as C and AC = 3 and CB = 3

AC + CB = 3 + 3 = 6

Let AB is the direct path then according to pythagoras theorem

AB = sqrt(AC^2 + CB^2)

AB = sqrt(9 + 9)
AB = sqrt(18)
AB = 4.47 which is smaller than 6
