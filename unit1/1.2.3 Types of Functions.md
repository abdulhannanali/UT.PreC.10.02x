## Types of functions

### 1. Devise and explain on your own two examples each of:

-    A surjective function that is not injective.
-    An injective function that is not surjective.
-    A bijective function.

#### Surjective function that is not injective

A function in which every element of range is corresponding to an element in domain but there's not one to one correspondance between them.

An example of such a function is

f(x) = {(1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 3)}

The *range* of this function is A = {1, 2, 3} and *domain* of this function is B = {2, 3}. Here, 1 and 2 both correspond to 2 in domain and all the elements in B has at least one matching element in A. So, this function is  surjective and not injective.

#### Injective function that is not surjective

The example of such function is

f(x) = {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)}

The domain of this function is A = {1, 2, 3} and range of this function B = {2, 3, 4, 5} The *f(x)* has a complete one-one correspondance which makes it injective but there's 	no matching element in domain for 5 so it's not surjective.

#### Example of a bijective function

f(x) = {(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8), (9, 10)}

The domain of the function is A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}

The range of the function is B = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}

The function is injective and surjective. So, it's a bijective function

2. Charactarize the function *f* pictured here

Answer: This function is surjective
