## Function Foundations

### 3. What happens if the domain and range have the same number of elements?

Answer: If this happens there are some cases possible 

- Each element in domain corresponds to each unique element in the range
- All the elements in the domain correspond to only one element in the range such as the function *f(x) = 0* will output 0 for any real number
- Two or more domain elements correspond to the same range element making the order arbitrary

What happens if the domain and range have infinitely many elements?

The same rules above apply in this case too but a function rule


### 10. Think of a generalization or set of rules to help compute the natural domain of a function?

The set of rules or generalization I can think of in order to compute the natural domain of the function are:

-	If the function contains x in the form of 1/x then x should not be equal to 0

	Such as in the function 

	f(x) = 1/(x - 4)(x + 2)

	The denominator for part should not be equal to 0
	if x = 4 and x = -2 the denomintor part becomes 0 which makes it infinity

	So the domain of this function includes all the real number excluding 4 and -2

-	If the function contains x in the form sqrt(x) then x >= 0

	Such as in the function 

	f(x) = sqrt(x)

	x should be greater than or equal to 0 otherwise it becomes an imaginary number such as sqrt(-1) is an imaginary number

### 11. Think about when a function is increasing

A function is increasing if for every increasing x the value of f(x) is also increasing.
Such as in `f(x) = x + 1`

for `x = 3` *f(x)* is 4
for `x = 4` *f(x)* is 5

Similarly a function is decreasing if for increasing value of x f(x) is decreasing such as f(x) = x -1


A function is increasing if for each increasing x the y is also increasing.
